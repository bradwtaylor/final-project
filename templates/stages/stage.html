		['Stage 3: Program With Objects',[['Object Oriented Programming Overview',[['What is Object Oriented Programming?', '<p>Object Oriented Programming is based on objects.  A simple program can be written in a series of instructions that are followed from A to Z.  As the program becomes more complicated it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain/update and harder to understand.  In OOP objects are the focus.  The program manipulates the objects to provide the desired output.</p>  

					<p>A class is a definition of an object, including all of the attributes and functions that are defined for the object.  Instead of defining multiple variables which are of a similar type independently and writing the same code over and over, using OOP the class is defined one time and then the objects are instances of the class which operate independently.  Without using OOP if we wanted to write a program for the inventory of a candy store we would need a separate function for each type of candy as well as unique variables for each attribute for each type of candy.  However, using OOP we could create a class called candy.  Within the class the attributes and methods would be assigned, including variables that could define the price, weight, calories, amount of inventory etc.  The class would also include methods which would be able to be called by the instances, for example to recalculate the inventory after a purchase or receiving a new shipment.  Each type of candy would be defined as an instance of the class and inherit the attributes and methods.  Each instance would be independently assigned its own values of price, weight and amount of inventory.  Other types of inventory that the store sells, like drinks or gift boxes, could each have their own class. </p>

					<p>Using OOP prevents repetitive programming of multiple variables with the same attributes.  In the example of a candy store with hundreds of types of candy this would make the programming much simpler by reducing repetition.  This also makes it easier to update the program later on if you wanted to change the attributes or methods for the class. </p>

					<p>Two important aspects of using OOP are to reduce repetition and simplify the structure of the program.</p>'],['Main Concepts in OOP', '<li>Class = like a blueprint or a generic description.  Contains information about the class, including variables and methods.</li>
					<li>Instance = an object whose type is of some class, interchangeable with object.</li>
					<li>Object = a specific instance of a class. </li>
					<li>Method = a function that is defined inside a class definition and is invoked on instances of that class.</li>
					<li>Module = a file containing Python definitions and statements.</li>
					<li>Attribute = variables and methods that make up a class.</li>
					<li>Library = a collection of modules of code that can be imported and then used by a program.</li>
					<li>Class Variables = a variable that is constant between all instances of the class.  If the variable is changed it changes for all instances that use the class variable.</li>
					<li>Inheritance = A child class can be created using a pre-existing parent class.  The child class will inherit the methods of the parent class, in addition to new methods only applied to the child class.</li>
					<li>Method overriding = A child class will inherit the method of the parent class.  However, it can be overridden by defining the same method for the child class.</li>'], 
        ['Connections between OOP and HTML/CSS', '<p>The way classes work in Python is similar to the way class definitions work in HTML and CSS.  In an HTML document if you want a certain structure with similar items formatted the same way then instead of redefining the formatting over and over you can create a class within the CSS file that defines all of the parameters once and then call it whenever it needs to be applied.  Multiple types of classes can be defined within the CSS file representing all the different formatting styles you are using within the HTML document.  In the HTML coding there will be a link tag that references the style sheet you are using for that page, which is similar to importing a module in python for a specific function you want to use.  The HTML code is simplified by reducing repetition and any change needed to the formatting of the page can be done very easily by updating the CSS document which are also some of the benefits you gain through using OOP.</p>

					<p>Additionally, in the same way that class definitions in Python have inheritance, there is also inheritance with the styles in the HTML file.  A child element will inherit the properties of the parent.  Similar to method overriding in Python, style elements in CSS can also be overridden if a property that is defined for the parent is also defined for the child.  The formatting for the child element will be a combination of the inherited values from the parent as well as the style defined specifically for the child.

        ['Stage 4:  Allow Comments',[['Servers, Validation and Templates',[['Servers', '<p>The purpose of a server is to respond to http requests.  There are two types of responses, static and dynamic.  An example of a static response would be when your browser requests an image.  The image resides on the server and when you request it, the server simply returns the image over the internet to the web browser on your computer.  Dynamic responses are when the page you are requesting is assembled on the server based on the parameters it receives.  Almost all websites today are dynamic.  They are generated on the fly by web applications. </p> 
<p>
Parameters can be passed to the server by using 2 types of requests, get and post.  The following are the differences between the two types of requests
</p>
<ol>
Get Request
<li>parameters in URL</li>
<li>Used for fetching documents</li>
<li>Limited to Maximum URL length</li>
<li>Ok to cache</li>
<li>Shouldn’t change the server</li></ol>

<li>parameters in body</li>
<li>Used for updating data</li>
<li>No maximum length... Defined by server</li>
<li>Not ok to cache</li>
<li>Ok to change the server</li></ol>
<p>
Get requests would be used to select what you are wanting to receive from the server.  For example it may include information about the page you are on, or what document you are wanting to download. The server will be able to retrieve the values of the get parameters and use that information to generate the web page.   Post requests are used to update the data on the server.  For example submitting information to the server like a post to the comment section on a website..  The server will take the information in the post parameter and update the server accordingly.</p>'],

['The Importance of Validating Input', '<p>Validation refers to verifying on the server side that what we received is what we expected to receive.
When processing information submitted by users it&#39s possible that someone could send invalid information which could cause problems with our page.</p>

<p>One solution is to use dropdown boxes with the valid inputs so the user is limited to a specific set of values.  Another solution is to validate the data entered against a pre-determined list of valid inputs.  For example if you were asking for a date to be entered you could compare the month entered against a list containing the months of the year.  If someone entered anything else it would fail validation.</p>

<p>Another issue that can happen is if a user submits text to a form and the text has html code in it.  When the website displays the data the user entered, instead of showing the text of the html code, it could be interpreted as html and allow the user to change the appearance or content of the site.</p>

<p>The way to prevent this is to escape the input.  Escaping will replace the characters used in html with a string that will be rendered on the page as the html character.  <br>
	For example:<br><ol>
	<li>&lt; will be replaced with &amp;lt;</li>
	<li>&quot; will be replaced with &amp;quot;</li>
	<li>&amp; will be replaced with &amp;amp;</li></ol>
	The browser will replace the strings with the character it represents, so on the page it will look like html, but the browser will not treat it as if it was html.</p>
	<p>If a user submitted &lt;b&gt;"Hello World!"&lt;/b&gt; and it was escaped, in the HTML it would appear as: <br>&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;"Hello World!"&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;</p><p>
But in the browser would appear just the way the user typed it.  The bold tags would be ignored because it isn&#39t in actual html format.</p>'], 


['HTML Templates and Abstraction', '<p>Templates allow you to avoid repetition and make complex applications much more easily.  There are many template libraries available.  One useful template library is jinja2, which is built into Google App Engine.
A template library is a library used to build complicated strings.  The strings that are generated can be html.  Templates allow the web pages to be generated dynamically instead of having multiple static pages.  Repetition is limited by reducing the amount of coding that needs to be done.  When a change needs to be made to the page there will be fewer lines of code needing to be updated.</p>

<p>One way templates reduce repetition is through inheritance.  If there are multiple pages on a website that will share the same structure or content on all pages, you can create a base page that all other other pages will inherit from.  All html that is shared will be included in the base page.  Jinja2 syntax will be included on the base page mark the area where content will be inserted from the sub-pages.  Also, jinja2 syntax will be included on the sub pages defining the content to be inserted.</p>

<p>The benefits of templates include:<ol>
<li>Allow you to separate different types of code.  Python code can be kept separate from html.</li>
<li>Make more readable code</li>
<li>More secure websites by using built in auto-escaping features of the templates</li>
<li>html that is easier to modify</li></ol></p>']]]]], 

['Stage 5: Explore - JavaScript and jQuery',[['JavaScript and jQuery',[['JavaScript', 
'<p>The two main tools used when developing a website using JavaScript are a text editor to code and a browser to inspect our work.  All modern browsers include developer tools which includes a console that allows the user to enter java commands and see errors on the page.</p>
<p>The syntax for assigning variables in JavaScript is:</p>
<div class=”codestage5”>
var {varible name} = {value};</div>

<p>The concept of true and false in JavaScript can be confusing.  In JavaScript there are values that can evaluate to true or false, without actually being true or false.  The values are referred to as truthy or falsy.  Truthy can include true, non-zero numbers, strings, objects, arrays and functions.  Falsy can include false, 0, &ldquo;&rdquo;, undefined, null and NaN.  Two links that I found useful in explaining this more were: <a class="linkintext" href="http://opensourcehacker.com/2012/10/17/true-lies-and-falsy-values-in-python-and-javascript/">http://opensourcehacker.com/2012/10/17/true-lies-and-falsy-values-in-python-and-javascript/</a>
and <a class="linkintext" href="http://www.sitepoint.com/javascript-truthy-falsy/">http://www.sitepoint.com/javascript-truthy-falsy/</a></p>

<p>There are 3 ways to assign values.  If you wanted to assign an array with an indexes for &ldquo;name&rdquo; and &ldquo;age&rdquo; and the associated values, it could be done in the 3 ways below:</p>

Object literal notation: <br>
var bio = {&ldquo;name&rdquo; : &ldquo;Brad&rdquo;, &ldquo;age&rdquo; : 42};<br><br>
Dot notation: <br>
bio.name = &ldquo;Brad&rdquo;;<br>
bio.age = 42;<br><br>
Bracket notation:<br>
bio[&ldquo;name&rdquo;] = &ldquo;Brad&rdquo;;<br>
bio[&ldquo;age&rdquo;] = 42;<br>
<p>Dot and bracket notation don&rsquo;t need a preceding &ldquo;var&rdquo; because they are not declaring a new variable, but are appending new properties to an existing object.</p>

<p>JavaScript, like other programming languages, also has if statements and loops (for, for in, and while).  Also, for cleaner code, functions can be assigned to process the inputs and return data.</p>

['jQuery', '<p>jQuery is a JavaScript library that can be used to manipulate the DOM of websites.  The DOM of a website can be represented like a tree, similar to a family tree.  There are Parents at the top, nested inside the parent element are the children.  Elements on the same level are siblings. </p>

<p>jQuery can be used to manipulate elements on websites by referencing specific tags, classes, id&rsquo;s or even specific text to modify data by appending, replacing, inserting, modifying etc..  For instance: If you wanted to insert some HTML code within an specific div on a website you could use the .append() function.  If a div had an id=&rdquo;abc123&rdquo; you could use $(&ldquo;#abc123&rdquo;).append(xxxxx); where xxxxx could be a variable representing the data you wanted to append.  The variable could be a string of text, or even a string of HTML code that would be inserted and then interpreted by the browser. </p>

<p>There are many functions in jQuery.  </p>


<p>An example of using jQuery from my Resume website is below:</p>

<p>There are variables that contain HTML code that will be modified and appended to the resume website.  HTMLskillsStart will display the header for the Skills section.  It has an id=&rdquo;skills&rdquo; that will be used to key off of when appending the individual skills.
The variables containing the HTML code are defined first.  Notice that HTMLskills has %data% which is just a placeholder.  We will use the .replace() function to replace that string with the text we want to display on the website:</p>

<div class="codestage5">var HTMLskillsStart = &#39;&lt;h3 id=&quot;skills-h3&quot;&gt;Skills at a Glance:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul id=&quot;skills&quot; class=&quot;flex-box&quot;&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&#39;;<br>
var HTMLskills = &#39;&lt;li class=&quot;flex-item&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;white-text&quot;&gt;%data%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#39;;

$(&quot;#header&quot;).append(HTMLskillsStart);</div>
 -- this code looks for the id=&rdquo;header&rdquo; on the existing website and appends the code in HTMLskillsStart
 
<div class="codestage5">var formattedSkills = HTMLskills.replace(&quot;%data%&quot;, bio.skills[skill]);</div> -- this line looks in variable HTMLskills and replaces &lsquo;%data%&rsquo; with a specific skill from the list of skills stored in bio.skills and assigns that new HTML code to variable formattedSkills. 

<div class="codestage5">$(&quot;#skills&quot;).append(formattedSkills);</div>  -- this line appends the HTML code in formattedskills after the id=&rdquo;skills&rdquo; which was in HTMLskillsStart that was appended earlier.

<p>The original HTML looked like this:</p>
<div class="codestage5">&lt;div id=&quot;header&quot; class=&quot;center-content clear-fix&quot;&gt;<br>
&lt;/div&gt;</div>

Once the javascript runs it would look like this:<br>
<div class="codestage5">
&lt;div id=&quot;header&quot; class=&quot;center-content clear-fix&quot;&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;h3 id=&quot;skills-h3&quot;&gt;Skills at a Glance:&lt;/h3&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;ul id=&quot;skills&quot; class=&quot;flex-box&quot;&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;li class=&quot;flex-item&quot;&gt;&lt;span  class=&quot;white-text&quot;&gt;Skill # 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/ul&gt;<br>
&lt;/div&gt;</div>

<p>A useful resource that I used to learn more about jQuery was: <a class="linkintext" href="https://jquery.org/projects/">https://jquery.org/projects/</a>.  This site has links to several other related sites with in depth information about different aspects of jQuery.  Here is a summary of the resources accessible from this site:</p>  

<ol>
<li><a class="linkintext" href="https://jquery.org/projects/">https://jquery.org/projects/</a> lists all of the projects that the jQuery foundation supports including <a class="linkintext" href="http://api.jquery.com">api.jquery.com</a>, <a class="linkintext" href="http://api.jqueryui.com">api.jqueryui.com</a>, <a class="linkintext" href="http://api.jquerymobile.com">api.jquerymobile.com</a>, and <a class="linkintext" href="http://learn.jquery.com">learn.jquery.com</a>.  These websites have a lot of information, documentation and examples of jQuery.</li>
<li>The <a class="linkintext" href="http://api.jquery.com/">jQuery API</a> site lists everything available in jQuery core with descriptions, examples and demos of each one.</li>
<li>The <a class="linkintext" href="http://api.jqueryui.com/">jQuery User Interface</a> documentation site contains info regarding all of the user interface interactions, effects, widgets, and themes available using jQuery.  There is also a Demo section that allows you to see the UI&#39;s in action and all of the available options as well as view the source code. </li>
<li>There is also a <a class="linkintext" href="http://api.jquerymobile.com/">jQuery Mobile</a> documentation available as well.   This site has documentation, examples and demos of jQuery Mobile which is used to buiild sites and apps to be accessible on smartphones and tablets.</li>
<li>The <a class="linkintext" href="http://learn.jquery.com/">Learning Center</a> site has chapters covering many topics. Each topic has descritpions and examples allowing you to learn about all aspects of jQuery.  </li>
<li>Each of these sites are easily searchable to find information about any function, method, event handlers etc.  Each entry is clearly laid out with proper syntax and descriptions.  The demo sites on the jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile sites allow you to see capabilities of the code in action as well as all of the options available and the source code for the demo.  It is interesting to me to see how easy it is to incorporate the elements from the jQuery library in a website to make it more appealing, interactive and user friendly.</li>
